# Admin Self-Protection Guide

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Cannot Remove Their Own Admin Role
- When an admin tries to remove their own admin role, they get an error
- This prevents accidental lockouts from the admin panel
- Only other admins can demote an admin

### 2. Admin Cannot Delete Their Own Account
- Admins cannot delete themselves from the user management page
- This prevents accidental account deletion
- Admins can delete other users but not themselves

### 3. Visual Indicators
- In the user management page, the current admin sees "You (Current Admin)" instead of action buttons
- This makes it clear which account is theirs
- Prevents confusion when managing multiple admin accounts

## 👤 Admin vs User Roles

### What Admins Can Do:
✅ Access admin dashboard (`/owners/admin`)
✅ Create products
✅ View all products
✅ Delete products
✅ View all users
✅ Promote users to admin
✅ Demote other admins to users
✅ Delete other users
✅ **Shop and buy products** (just like regular users)
✅ Have their own cart
✅ Have their own orders

### What Regular Users Can Do:
✅ Browse products in the shop
✅ Add products to cart
✅ View their cart
✅ Access their account page
❌ Cannot access admin panel
❌ Cannot create/edit/delete products
❌ Cannot view or manage other users

## 🛒 Important: Admins Can Shop Too!

**Admins are NOT just managers - they're also customers!**

- Admins can click "View Shop" from the admin panel
- Admins can browse and add products to their cart
- Admins have their own shopping cart separate from their admin duties
- Admins can purchase products just like any user

**Think of it this way:**
- **Admin Panel** = Your "back office" to manage the store
- **Shop** = Your "storefront" where you can also be a customer

**Example Scenario:**
1. Admin creates a new product (iPhone 15)
2. Admin visits shop to see how it looks to customers
3. Admin likes the product and adds it to their cart
4. Admin purchases it just like any customer would

## 🔐 Protection Rules

### Rule 1: Self-Preservation
```
IF action_target == current_admin THEN
    BLOCK action
    SHOW error message
END IF
```

### Rule 2: Other Users
```
IF action_target != current_admin THEN
    ALLOW action
END IF
```

---

## 📋 Testing the Protection

### Test 1: Try to Remove Your Own Admin Role
1. Login as admin
2. Go to "Manage Users"
3. Find your own account
4. Notice: No "Remove Admin" button for yourself
5. See: "You (Current Admin)" text instead

### Test 2: Try to Delete Your Own Account
1. Login as admin
2. Go to "Manage Users"
3. Find your own account
4. Notice: No "Delete" button for yourself
5. Backend also blocks this if attempted directly

### Test 3: Admin Shopping
1. Login as admin
2. Click "View Shop" in sidebar
3. Browse products
4. Add items to cart
5. View cart - see your items
6. Return to admin panel - still have admin access

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Admin Management:
1. **Always have at least 2 admins** - in case one needs help
2. **Don't demote yourself** - system prevents this anyway
3. **Be careful when deleting users** - action is permanent
4. **Test changes on non-admin accounts first**

### For Product Management:
1. **Create products as admin**
2. **Test them by shopping as admin** - see how customers see them
3. **Make adjustments based on your shopping experience**

### For Multi-Admin Environments:
1. **Coordinate with other admins** before making changes
2. **Don't demote other admins** without communication
3. **Keep track of who manages what**

After login, you can navigate freely:
- **Admin** can visit `/shop` anytime
- **User** is blocked from `/owners/*` routes
